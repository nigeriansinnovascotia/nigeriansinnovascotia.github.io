<p class="style2"><strong><em>14.07 Leave of Absent</em></strong><br/>
    <em>Under extreme circumstance the association may satisfy section 14.06 of  these bylaws by invoking leave of absent. The leave of absent requires a member  of executive to step aside from his position for a period not exceeding two  months.

The outgoing member(s) of the executive shall be eligible for re-election. </em></p>
<p class="style2"><strong><em>15.02 </em></strong> <br/>
    <em>Any  member of the executive or any other position in the Society may be removed  from office by a motion passed by a simple majority of members present. Any  position thus opened shall be considered vacant. </em> </p>
